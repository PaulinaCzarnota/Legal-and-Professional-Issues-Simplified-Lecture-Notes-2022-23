I have transcribed my professor's lecture mind maps for the Legal and Professional Issues module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. The mind maps are organized by theme and cover Sources of Law, Introduction to Ethics, Contract Law, Intellectual Property Rights, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). They provide a comprehensive overview of the main concepts and topics discussed in class for each theme.
